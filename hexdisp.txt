						HEX DISPLAY

	This program is shows a couple of things. One the use of the 
DosAllocHuge API call. This one of the things that OS/2 does very well.
OS/2 supports virual memory which means that you can use more memory that
you have install in the computer. When all of the Ram is used then OS/2
swapping to the disk, so you have almost unlimited memory (up to the free
space on your disk).

	This program was copied out of the book called
					OS/2 Programmer's Guide
					written by Ed Iacobucci

I had to make modifications to the program to make it work properly. The
program did not support the IBM enhanced keyboard and the fopen function
was not written correctly. I change some other routines because of errors
in them.
	I'm including the source code for the program, but I can not include
the file called : Doscalls.inc as that is a copywrited file by Microsoft.
You can very easily create the macro's included in this file. 
	I included a version of the program that was made using the FAM API
which means that it will run both under OS/2 and DOS. The hexdisp.com
file will work under both OS/2 and DOS and the file hexdisp.exe will work
under OS/2 only. Notice the difference in size !!
